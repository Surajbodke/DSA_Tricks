# DSA Tricks

# 1)Monotonic stack/Queue

- Linear data structure (array, linked list, queues) - something you can scan left to right
- O(n) time - Stack helps avoid nested loops by making a single pass
- Next or previous comparison - directional lookup(Greater, smaller, warmer, taller)
- Sliding window min or max or consecutive k element(Process a segment of total)(Monotonic Queue)(Fixed window size)
- Problems related to histograms or bars.
- Lexi graphically increasing or decreasing mention

# 2) Recursion

- Problem shrink with each step
- Multiple branching choices
- All combinations, count the number of ways/steps , or generate all possible solutions
- Tree, graph traversal
- Divide and conquer structure
- Small constraints + exponential output
- Time complexity hints like O(2^n), O(n!), or O(logn)
- A Base case and a Recursive step
- Tail Recursion (When recursive call is last operation)
- Think if I shrink the input slightly would the problem look the same
- Flattening type question or reverse of this

# 3)Backtracking

- Recursion + undo if path doesn’t exist

# 4) Dynamic programming(Memoization)

- Recursion + overlapping problems
- Whenever you see
1. Branches in multiple ways
2. Those branches may revisit the same sub-states

# 5)Strings

- Check rfind stl once
- ‘a’ +32 =’A’ always remember
- Upper bound and lower bound stl check once

## Pattern matching

1. KMP algorithm

[https://youtu.be/qases-9gOpk?si=8gmLOE3q-Gs6-UvF](https://youtu.be/qases-9gOpk?si=8gmLOE3q-Gs6-UvF)

- First step LPS construction
- Second step KMP construction
- LPS on pattern string
- LPS[i]→0 to i→longest prefix and suffix that are equal
- Prefix=suffix mention
- Single pattern search in a long string
- Avoiding re-comparisons or optimising charcter checks
- Problem says longest border, happy prefix or similar
- Guaranteed O(n+m) needed due to tight constraints
- Input contains non ASCII character, symbols that make hashing unreliable
- Solving string problem like find first match, count occurrences, find longest prefix that is also a suffix
1. Rabin Karp algorithm 

# 6)Linked List

- Hare and tortoise method
- Reservoir sampling method

> When the list is very big and you don't know the size and have to pick random element(K) with equal probability
>

# 7)Stack

- When asked to do adjacent elimination and maintain the order while doing this
- Mostly when operator are mentioned stack is used(Evaluate expression, in order/preorder expression)
- Stringstream must remember for tokenization

# 8)Binary Search

- When array is sorted
- When you have to find the minimum or maximum before the conditon become fasle
- Find the leftmost or rightmost answer
- O(log(N)) time complexity

[https://youtu.be/cw5XhYeAU5o?si=wOsngPAsYlWJsCYY](https://youtu.be/cw5XhYeAU5o?si=wOsngPAsYlWJsCYY)

- Remember in rotated array you can solve two parts of array at the pivot by applying binary search on both parts
- If array is sorted and has duplicates consider skipping them
- Minimize and maximize using in the question
- Always try to look for “if this position/value doesn't work how will the next/greater than the value will work or vice-versa”

# 9)Sliding window

- Contigous subarray is asked for maximum or minimum
- one pass and two pass sliding window
- Talking about Count of substring/subarray
- Charcters frequency is being talked about
- Number of subarray between i and j are n-j
- Mentioned about subarray and some property to satisfy
- Total number of subarray j-i+1 or 2^n-1
- Subarray + k size

# 10)Greddy

- Tell you to make optimize the solution at each step
- can be confused with binary  serach
- Minimum number of taps or crakers longest reach or jump game 2 type questions

# 11) Dynamic Programming

- Types of question 1D based, 2D based, string based, Grid based, Game strategy
- Types of solution are Recursion+Memoization, Bottom up
- To solve start with
1. Tree diagram
2. Reporting subproblem
3. Recursion
4. Memoization
- LIS based questions look into it very important(DP onn 1D)
- DP on strings(LCS and SCS)

- DP realated to palindromes(BluePrint check once)
- DP on grids
1. Each cell might have a cost or reward 
2. Goal would be to find optimal path or optimal value
3. Finding mini/maxi path sum in grid
4. Number of ways to reach a cell
5. with constraints like avoding some obstacles
6. Movements that can be down in grid are top/bottom/left/right/digonally
- Key idea is to comppute the results for given cell based on previously computed results of neighbouring cell
- Types of problem in Dp on grids are
1. Unique paths
2. Minimum path sum /Minimum cost path
3. Shortest path in grid
4. Game board
5. Matrix/Grid traversal/walk
- There is this concept in dp and i also think in some other techniques where you can get the answer of particular point from past points always remember this for refrence once go throught the attached video
